**Objective:**

Build a RESTful API for a Dynamic Knowledge Base System. This system should
manage interconnected topics and resources with version control, user roles, and
permissions. The challenge will assess the candidateâ€™s ability to implement
complex business logic, use advanced OOP concepts, design patterns, and
algorithms, as well as maintain high code quality and testing standards.

**Requirements:**

**Project Setup:**\
Create a new Node.js project using TypeScript.\
Set up an Express server.\
Use a database (an in-memory database or a simple file-based database like JSON)
for persistence.

1. **Core Functionality:**

**Entities:**

- **Topic**: Represents a subject or concept within the knowledge base.
  - Properties: `id`, `name`, `content`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `version`,
    `parentTopicId` (for hierarchical structure).
- **Resource**: Represents an external link or document associated with a topic.
  - Properties: `id`, `topicId`, `url`, `description`, `type` (e.g., video,
    article, pdf), `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
- **User**: Represents a user who can access the knowledge base.
  - Properties: `id`, `name`, `email`, `role` (Admin, Editor, Viewer),
    `createdAt`.

**Topic Management:**

- Implement CRUD operations for **Topics** with version control. Each update to
  a topic should create a new version, keeping the previous versions intact.
- Support hierarchical topics, allowing each topic to have parent and child
  topics

## 

2. ## Complex Business Logic:

## Topic Version Control and Retrieval:

- Create a versioning system for topics where each update does not overwrite the
  existing topic but instead creates a new version. Implement functionality to
  retrieve a specific version of a topic.

## Recursive Topic Retrieval:

- Implement an API endpoint that, given a topic ID, retrieves the topic and all
  its subtopics recursively. The response should include a tree structure
  representing the hierarchy of topics.

## Custom Algorithms:

- Implement a custom algorithm to find the shortest path between two topics in
  the topic hierarchy. This algorithm should not use common graph traversal
  libraries; it should be written from scratch to assess the candidate's
  problem-solving skills.

3. ## Advanced Object-Oriented Design:

- Use **abstract classes** and **interfaces** to model the entities and their
  behaviors.
- Implement design patterns like **Factory** (to create different versions of
  topics), **Strategy** (for different user roles and permissions), and
  **Composite** (for hierarchical topics).

4. ## Code Structure and Quality:

- Organize the code into well-defined modules, such as controllers, services,
  models, routes, and middleware.
- Follow SOLID principles and apply design patterns to ensure code
  maintainability and scalability.

5. ## Error Handling and Validation:

- Implement comprehensive error handling for all endpoints and business logic.

6. ## Unit and Integration Testing (Bonus):

- Write unit tests for all services and controllers using a testing framework
  like Jest or Mocha.
- Create integration tests to test the overall flow of the application,
  including user permissions and topic retrieval.
- Ensure high test coverage and demonstrate how to mock dependencies.

## Submission:

- Please submit your project as a GitHub repository. Ensure the repository
  includes a README file with instructions on how to run the project, set up the
  database, and perform authentication.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Correctness and completeness of functionality.
- Proper use of advanced object-oriented programming principles and design
  patterns.
- Ability to implement complex business logic and custom algorithms.
- Clean, readable, and well-structured code with appropriate modularization.
- Robust error handling, logging, and validation.
- Quality, coverage, and depth of unit and integration tests.
